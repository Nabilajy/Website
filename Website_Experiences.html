<p>áƒ¦ Here I will share about the journey of my study during diploma at Universiti Teknologi Mara Campus Machang </p>

<p>This marked the beginning of my education journey at University Teknologi Mara. The university environment is significantly different from the school environment, and it is also a place where I may experience a variety of memories and lessons that help me mature. Particularly in terms of being friends, and they were among the first people I met while attending a university.</p>

<p>They are the ones who gain the most valuable experience during their diploma year. We didn't say hello to one other at first, but after a few months of being classmates, we became closer and formed a complimentary family. Despite this, our intimacy in the actual world is only ephemeral because of the covid-19 . We were only able to communicate with each other through the internet, but this did not diminish our feelings for one another.</p>

<p>I had to study online (ODL) for three semesters as Malaysia was afflicted by the covid-19 outbreak. So I used my PTPTN loan money to buy chairs, tables, and other study necessities to make my studies more comfortable. Because I do not have such tools, it fuels my desire to study more rigorously. As you may be concerned, learning online at home while juggling multiple commitments is quite difficult, but I made it to the finish, and Alhamdulillah, for the first time, I was able to carry the title of "Dean List."</p><br>
