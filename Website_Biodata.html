<p style="text-align: center;">Hello! Here are some secret about me will be expose!âœ¨</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">So I will start with my background of life :)</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">A little introduction to myself, Kota Bharu Hospital was the place of my birth, which occurred on December 22, 2001. There are eight siblings, and I am the fourth. Now, I am a teenager on the verge of becoming an adult lady, and I have reached the age of twenty-one (21). I'm from the state of Kelantan, which is known as "serambi Mekkah." Currently I'am senior student studying information management at Universiti Teknologi Mara. Introvert is a good way to describe my personality. Why? Due to with meeting new people, especially strangers, make me feels uncomfortable. To them, I must appear haughty, but as they come to know me better, they will discover that I am a cheerful person. I am also a person who is concerned with cleanliness. In order to live a healthy and happy life, it is essential to maintain a clean and orderly environment. In contrast, I find cleaning to be therapeutic for me; it may not seem rational to others, but it is so for me. Otherwise, I consider myself a girl who is modest in all that I do, as well as spontaneous and enjoyful when interactions with other people. </p><br>
